Implementation Details for Part B

Verification steps from the Root:

Root Zone
DNS resolver starts with a pre-configured root zone trust anchor (Root KSK)
Resolver queries root zone for DNSKEY records
Root zone returns DNSKEY records (KSK and ZSK) with RRSIG
Resolver validates root DNSKEY RRset using the trust anchor

TLD Zone (.com in this example)
Root zone provides DS record for .com TLD
Resolver queries .com TLD servers for DNSKEY records
.com returns DNSKEY records (KSK and ZSK) with RRSIG
Resolver validates .com DNSKEY RRset using .com's DS record from root

Domain Zone (example.com)
.com TLD provides DS record for example.com
Resolver queries example.com authoritative servers for DNSKEY records
example.com returns DNSKEY records (KSK and ZSK) with RRSIG
Resolver validates example.com DNSKEY RRset using its DS record from .com TLD

Resource Records
Resolver queries for desired resource record (e.g., A record for www.example.com)
Authoritative server returns requested record with RRSIG
Resolver validates the record's RRSIG using example.com's ZSK
Final Steps
If all validations succeed, resolver returns the authenticated responset
If any validation fails, resolver returns that the 'Verification of DNSSEC' failed
